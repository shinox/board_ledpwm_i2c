# board_ledpwm_i2c
based on simavr, Atmega32 test of pwm dimming LED and FAN control

Clone to "simavr/examples/" then make.

Idea to test ability of Atmega32 to software PWM 10x 10W LED lights and cooling FANs, providing cheap light alternative for Marine Aquarium.
 It is based on various other projects, mainly "simavr" for testing and core functionality,
 AVR note 136 (AVR136) modified to supply ~973Hz PWM,
